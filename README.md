## Features

- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for an entity (e.g., `Employee`)
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Global exception handling with custom error responses
- RESTful API with Spring Boot
- Maven build

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- Java 17
- Lombok (optional for reducing boilerplate code)

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- Postman or cURL (for testing API)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasanuzzaman-dev/spring-postgres-crud.git
cd spring-postgres-crud
```
### Step 2: Configure PostgreSQL Database
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create a new database and update the application.properties file with your database credentials:

```bash
# src/main/resources/application.yml

spring:
  application:
    name: spring-postgres-crud
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/spring-postgres-crud
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
```
### Step 3: Build and Run the Application
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
```csharp

### Instructions
- Replace the GitHub repository URL with your actual repository.
- Adjust the package names, project-specific details, and paths as per your project structure.
- You may also add additional sections such as deployment instructions if needed.
